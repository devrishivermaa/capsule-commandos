# Multiclass Abnormality Classification Task and Video Capsule Endoscopy

## Overview
This repository contains the *capsule-commandos'* submission for the **Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge**. The project focuses on multi-class abnormality classification in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) frames, aiming to achieve accurate, automated detection of abnormalities.
our team capsule commandos achieved 7th place ranking with a test set performance of Mean AUC: 0.7314 and balanced accuracy: 0.3235. 

### Key Features
- **Deep Learning Models**: Includes Vision Transformers, CNNs, and ResNet architectures which we applied 
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes  resizing, flips, rotations, and normalization for robustness.
- **Collaboration**: Built with contributions from Dev Rishi Verma,Vibhor Saxena, Dhruv Sharma and Arpan Gupta.

## Repository Structure

The capsule-commandos repository for the Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge includes the following primary directories and files:

- **Code Files:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks with training scripts for various models aimed at improving abnormality detection. Notably, *davit.ipynb* is our primary submission model.
  
- **Evaluations:** This section includes Python scripts that generate Excel files and evaluation matrices, such as ROC curves and confusion matrices. It primarily focuses on our main *davit* model and contains generated Excel files with evaluation results. Similar evaluations for our other models can be created using the same methods.

- **Reports:** This directory holds JSON summaries of our models. The files *davit_val_eval.json* and *davit_training_eval.json* represent our final submissions.

- **CapsuleCommandos Arxiv.pdf:** This is version 1 of our arXiv report, available at [arXiv:2410.19973](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19973).

- **CapsuleCommandos_Arxiv_V2.pdf:** This is version 2 of our arXiv report.
