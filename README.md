# Multiclass Abnormality Classification Task and Video Capsule Endoscopy

## Overview
The Multiclass Abnormality Classification Task and Video Capsule Endoscopy project is designed to address the **Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge** by focusing on multi-class abnormality classification for video capsule endoscopy. The project leverages cutting-edge models and training techniques to enhance medical diagnostic capabilities. 

### Key Features
- **Deep Learning Models**: Includes Vision Transformers, CNNs, and ResNet architectures.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes  resizing, flips, rotations, and normalization for robustness.
- **Collaboration**: Built with contributions from Dev Verma, Dhruv Sharma, Vibhor Saxena, and Arpan Gupta.
