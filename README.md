## Overview
Capsule Commandos is a machine learning project designed to address the **Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge** by focusing on multi-class abnormality classification for video capsule endoscopy. The project leverages cutting-edge models and training techniques to enhance medical diagnostic capabilities. 

### Key Features
- **Deep Learning Models**: Includes Vision Transformers, CNNs, and ResNet architectures.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes histogram equalization, resizing, flips, rotations, affine transformations, color jittering, and normalization for robustness.
- **Custom Training Pipeline**: Optimized with batch size 32, learning rate 1e-4, and trained for 20 epochs.
- **Collaboration**: Built with contributions from Dhruv Sharma, Vibhor Saxena, and Arpan Gupta.
